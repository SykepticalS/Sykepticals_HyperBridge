# Build Guide

Build the HyperIsland APK from source. The app UI has migrated from Flutter to
native Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and Miuix. The UI and Xposed hooks now live in
the same Android Gradle project, so Flutter SDK and Dart are no longer required.

## Requirements

- JDK 21
- Android SDK API 37 (installed through Android Studio or command-line tools)

## Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1812z/HyperIsland.git
cd HyperIsland
```

2. Build the release APK:

```bash
./android/gradlew -p android :app:assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to `build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

The Gradle Wrapper is located under `android/`, but run the command from the
repository root. The `-p android` option selects the Android project directory.
The first build downloads Gradle, Compose, Miuix, and other dependencies.

## Build Variants

Debug build:

```bash
./android/gradlew -p android :app:assembleDebug
```

Fast release test build without R8 minification or resource shrinking:

```bash
./android/gradlew -p android :app:assembleReleaseFast
```

All variants package only `arm64-v8a`. Maintain `appVersionName` and
`appVersionCode` in `android/gradle.properties`.

## FAQ

::: details Build fails?
- Ensure `JAVA_HOME` points to JDK 21
- Ensure Android SDK API 37 is installed and its licenses are accepted
