## Step 3: Enable Focus Notification Bypass in HyperCeiler

> 💡 Super Island style notifications require HyperCeiler's "Focus Notification" bypass to display correctly. If your HyperCeiler version is too old, you may not find the corresponding options — please update to the latest version.

1. Open **HyperCeiler**, go to "System UI" or "Xiaomi Services Framework" settings
2. Find **"Remove Focus Notification Whitelist"** and **"Unlock Focus Notification Whitelist Verification"**

3. Enable and restart the scope

::: danger Built-in Bypass
The app includes a built-in whitelist bypass, but it doesn't support safe mode and may cause System UI to crash infinitely. Make sure you can recover your device before enabling.
